# CLAUDE.md — G1 Claude Terminal

This file gives Claude Code the context it needs to work effectively in this repo.

---

## What this project is

An **iOS-only** Flutter (Dart) mobile app that turns **Even Realities G1 smart
glasses** into a wearable Claude terminal.  The phone connects to the glasses
over dual BLE (one connection per arm), streams LC3 audio from the glasses
microphone, converts speech to text via the native platform layer, calls the
Claude API, and renders the reply on the glasses waveguide display.

> **Note:** Although built with Flutter, this app targets iOS exclusively.
> Android support is not a goal.  Prefer native iOS APIs (CoreLocation, MapKit,
> EventKit, etc.) over cross-platform pub.dev packages when possible.

## BLE protocol essentials

### Dual-BLE architecture
The G1 has **two independent BLE connections** (left arm = `L`, right arm = `R`).
Send to L first; only send to R after L acknowledges with `0xC9`.
`BleManager.sendBoth()` handles this sequencing.

### Key commands

| Direction | Command | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| App → Glasses | `0x0E 0x01` | Enable right mic |
| App → Glasses | `0x0E 0x00` | Disable mic |
| App → Glasses | `0x4E ...` | Send AI result / text page |
| Glasses → App | `0xF1 seq data` | LC3 audio chunk |
| Glasses → App | `0xF5 0x17` | Long-press: start Even AI |
| Glasses → App | `0xF5 0x18` | Stop recording |
| Glasses → App | `0xF5 0x01` | Single tap (page turn) |
| Glasses → App | `0xF5 0x00` | Double tap (exit) |
| Glasses → App | `0xF5 0x04/05` | Triple tap (mode cycle) |

### Display constraints
- Max width: **488 px**
- Font size: **21 px** (configurable)
- Lines per screen: **5**
- Text is split via `EvenAIDataMethod.measureStringList()` using Flutter's
  `TextPainter` — do not replace this with a naive character count.

### 0x4E packet `newscreen` byte

```
upper 4 bits — status:
  0x30  Even AI displaying (auto mode)
  0x40  Even AI display complete (last page, auto)
  0x50  Even AI manual mode
  0x60  Network error
  0x70  Text show

lower 4 bits — action:
  0x01  Display new content
```

## Even AI session lifecycle

```
[Long-press L]
  → 0xF5 0x17 received
  → EvenAI.toStartEvenAIByOS()
     → startListening()       ← begins partial STT transcript
     → openEvenAIMic()        ← sends 0x0E 0x01 to R arm
[Release]
  → 0xF5 0x18 received
  → EvenAI.recordOverByOS()
     → stopEvenAI native
     → check wake word in combinedText
     → call Claude API
     → startSendReply(answer)  ← paginates & sends via 0x4E
[Double-tap]
  → 0xF5 0x00 → App.exitAll() + EvenAI.clear()
```

---

## Adding the Claude API

### Endpoint
`POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`

### Required headers
```
x-api-key: <ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>
anthropic-version: 2023-06-01
content-type: application/json
```

### Minimal request body
```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "system": "...",
  "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"..."}]
}
```

### API key injection
```
flutter run --dart-define=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```
Access in Dart:
```dart
const String.fromEnvironment('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY', defaultValue: '')
```

---

## Session modes

| Mode | Trigger | System prompt focus | History |
|------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| `chat` | default | Concise general answers | Per-session |
| `code` | triple-tap L | Expert programmer, plain text code | Per-session |
| `cowork` | triple-tap R | Pair-programming, persistent context | Persisted |

Mode is shown in every page header sent to glasses: `[CHAT]`, `[CODE]`, `[WORK]`.

---

## Wake word

- Phrases detected client-side in the partial STT transcript.
- Default list: `['hey claude', 'ok claude', 'claude']`
- Strip the wake phrase from the query before sending to the API.
- If no wake phrase found and `requireWakeWord == true`, prompt the user on
  glasses: `Say "Hey Claude" to start`.

---

## Cowork relay (Claude Code integration)

For `cowork` mode the app optionally delegates to a local relay server instead
of calling the API directly.  The relay spawns `claude --print` CLI processes
and returns the output.

```
Flutter app  ──POST /query──►  relay (localhost:9090)
                               └─ claude --print "<msg>"
                               ◄── streamed response
```

The relay is a small Node.js script in `tools/relay/server.js`.
If the relay is unreachable, `cowork` mode falls back to direct API.

---

## Conventions and gotchas

- Always send L before R.  `BleManager.sendBoth()` is the safe wrapper.
- `Proto.sendEvenAIData()` assembles the 0x4E packet — don't build it manually.
- `EvenAIDataMethod.measureStringList()` must run on the **Flutter UI thread**
  because it uses `TextPainter`.  Do not call from an isolate.
- `isRunning` is both a bool and an `RxBool` — set it via the setter
  `EvenAI.isRunning = ...` to update both.
- `clear()` in `EvenAI` resets all state — always call it on exit paths.
- The existing `retryCount` / `maxRetry` retry loop in `sendEvenAIReply` is
  intentional; don't remove it.
- API keys must never be committed; use `--dart-define` or a `.env` approach.

## Running the app

```bash
# iOS
flutter run --dart-define=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... -d <ios-device>

# Android
flutter run --dart-define=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... -d <android-device>
```

Bluetooth requires a physical device — the simulator cannot test BLE.

## Running the cowork relay

```bash
cd tools/relay
npm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... node server.js
```
